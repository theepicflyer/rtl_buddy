# Regressions

A regression runs multiple test suites in sequence, filtering tests by regression level. It is the standard way to validate a full design before a release or merge.

## Regression config: `regressions.yaml`

```yaml
rtl-buddy-filetype: reg_config

test-configs:
  - "design/example_block_a/verif/tests.yaml"
  - "design/example_block_b/verif/tests.yaml"
```

Each entry in `test-configs` is a path to a suite's `tests.yaml`, resolved relative to the directory where `rtl-buddy regression` is invoked (usually the repo root).

The default path to `regressions.yaml` is set in `root_config.yaml` under `cfg-rtl-reg.reg-cfg-path`. Override it per run with `--reg-config`.

## Running a regression

Use the default config:

```bash
rtl-buddy regression
```

Specify a config file explicitly:

```bash
rtl-buddy regression --reg-config path/to/regressions.yaml
```

### Config resolution order

When `--reg-config` is not given, `rtl_buddy` resolves the regression config in this order:

1. `./regression.yaml` in the current working directory, if it exists
2. The path set in `root_config.yaml` under `cfg-rtl-reg.reg-cfg-path`

This means you can drop a `regression.yaml` at the repo root and run `rtl-buddy regression` without any flags, even if `root_config.yaml` points elsewhere.

Each suite's outputs land under that suite's own `tests.yaml` directory; the orchestration log and any merged coverage artifacts land under `dirname(regression.yaml)`. See [Execution Context](execution-context.md) for how the per-suite re-anchoring works.

### Regression levels

`rtl_buddy` filters tests by the `reglvl` value set in each `tests.yaml`. Use `--reg-level` and `--start-level` to select a range:

```bash
# Run all tests with reglvl <= 2000
rtl-buddy regression --reg-level 2000

# Run tests with reglvl in [1000, 3000]
rtl-buddy regression --start-level 1000 --reg-level 3000
```

The default is `--reg-level 0`, which runs only tests with `reglvl: 0` (must-run sanity tests).

## Working directory behavior

Unlike `test`, the `regression` subcommand **changes directory** into each suite directory before running its tests. This means relative paths in `tests.yaml` (such as `model_path`) are resolved correctly without any extra setup.

Run `regression` from the repo root so that the paths in `regressions.yaml` resolve correctly.
